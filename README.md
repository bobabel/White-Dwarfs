# White-Dwarfs
White dwarf candidates, culled from the Montreal White Dwarf Database and the Fusillo et al. 2021 tables at Warwick University are merged with SDSS and Gaia observations to produce color-magnitude plots for DA, DB and DC white dwarfs. These data are then binned by color and the median values are used to create polynomial fits to the data, creating C-M models in each of four SDSS colors (u-g, g-r, r-i and i-z) over the 8.5 ≤ �� ≤ 14.5 range.![image](https://github.com/bobabel/White-Dwarfs/assets/3171005/3ce53c03-d765-4de5-9178-1a4636f990ad)
